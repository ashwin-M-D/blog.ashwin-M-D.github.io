title: 'An Introduction: Who am I?'

## About me
My name is Ashwin Devanga and I am 22 years old. Currently, I am a master's student at Northeastern University, Boston. My field of study is Data Analytics Engineering. I did my B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. My major there was in Biotechnology. I also had the privilege of working at Chubu University, Japan for two summers in the field of theoretical reinforcement learning. In particular, I worked on one-shot learning.

## My Interests and Hobbies:
I am interested in machine learning. However, I am particularly interested in the theory behind the learning algorithms more than the practical application of the same algorithms. I have been coding since I was 12 years old and have coded in more than 20 languages over the last 10 years. I am also an avid basketball fan. I played basketball throughout middle and high school. I made team captain by the time I reached 10th grade.
<br /><br />
I am also interested in the Linux kernel and building minimalistic Operating Systems from scratch. I have not attended any official classes on Operating systems and I am still learning about them. I am not a contributor to any open-source project at the time I am writing this post, but I fully support the cause. I have a few projects of my own which I have made freely available on GitHub. I do wish to become an open-source contributor in the future if time permits.

<br />
## My Skills
I consider myself a proficient coder but I am not a software developer. I have not participated in any coding hackathons or any competitive coding environment. I prefer to call myself an applied mathematician or a theoretical machine learning researcher. Over the last ten years, I have coded in over 20 languages. Many of which are hardly used today. Examples of which are BASIC languages such as TrueBASIC, QBASIC, VB6, etc. The major languages which I use on a day to day basis are Python, JAVA, C, and sometimes R.
<br /><br />
I have also worked in web development but I am not very interested in it. Web development has a lot of prospects and though the industry was down a few years ago is starting to pick up again due to high-efficiency frameworks and total cloud computation ideologies which are taking the front seat. However, as I mentioned before, I am interested in mathematics than the development of products which is what web development is.
<br /><br />
My undergraduate major was in Biotechnology. My work was mainly in the field of Computational Biology and I worked under the supervision of Dr. P Satpati where I ran simulations and analyzed data on Human Beta Defensins and how they interact in a salty environment. Most simulations were run in NAMD and a few more in gromacs. The visualization software used was VMD and Pymol.
<br /><br />
During my undergraduate degree, I also had the opportunity to work with Prof. Koichiro Yamauchi, at Chubu University, Japan. Under his supervision, I published my first paper on one-shot learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. It focused on Human-Computer collaborative learning. The paper was published at ICPRAM 2019 held in Prague, Czech republic.

## My Plans and Aspirations
I wish to pursue a Ph.D. in Machine learning after I finish my MS at Northeastern University. I am have worked in research labs throughout my undergraduate degree and plan to do the same during my Master's degree as well.
<br /><br />
I also plan to write more blogs here as technical guides on topics in both machine learning and operating systems which I find interesting. As I have always said, If you have any doubts or need to contact me, please feel free to do so on my email ashwindevanga@live.com
